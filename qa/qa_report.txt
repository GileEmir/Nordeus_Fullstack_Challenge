ADDED FUNCTIONALITIES FOR BETTER GAME EXPERIENCE:

    1.Added interpolation for better look of the game,since we had only 30x30 grid:
        - Added interpolation to scale the map up so it looks more detailed and less pixelated.

    2.Red Borders for Chosen Islands:
        - Added red borders around islands to indicate which islands have already been chosen.

    3.Time Trial Mode:
        - Implemented a new game mode where players have 1 minute to guess as many high-scoring islands as possible.
        - Added a timer that pauses during the "Calculating..." phase.
        - Incremented the score for each correct guess and generated a new map.
        
    4.Precision Mode:
        - Implemented a new game mode with unlimited time but limited tries (10 wrong guesses).
        - Tracked and displayed the number of tries left in the top left corner.
        - Displayed messages for correct and wrong guesses at the bottom of the screen.

    5.Hover Effect:
        - Added a hover effect to highlight cells when the mouse is moved over the map.
    
    6.Flood Fill Visualization:
        - Added a flood fill visualization to show the area covered by each island.
        -I thought it would be fun to see what algorithm is used to calculate the area of the island.
        It could always be changed,in the first version it was just a BFS algorithm,but i liked the DFS visualization more.
    
    7.Created  a real game loop:
        - Added a game loop to handle the game states and transitions between them,allowing transitions between game modes and game over screens.


ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM THE QA REPORT:

    Description of bugs that came up - how you noticed and fixed them:
        1. Cached Map Data:
            - Noticed: The map data was not changing and seemed to be the same every time.
            - Fixed: Added a 'Cache-Control' header to the data fetch request to make sure we always get fresh data.

        2. Timer Not Pausing:
            - Noticed: The timer kept running even when the game was showing "Calculating..." in Time Trial Mode.
            - Fixed: Paused the timer during the flood fill process and resumed it after, by keeping track of the paused time.

        3. Incorrect Tries Left Display:
            - Noticed: The number of tries left sometimes went up instead of down in Precision Mode.
            - Fixed: Made sure the `tries_left` variable goes down correctly after a wrong guess and shows the right number in the top left corner.

        4. Video System Not Initialized Error:
            - Noticed: The game crashed with a "video system not initialized" error when closing the window with the X button.
            - Fixed: Added checks for the `pygame.QUIT` event in the `draw_precision_mode_summary` and `draw_winning_screen` functions to properly call `pygame.quit()` and exit the game.

        5. Red Borders Staying on Screen:
            - Noticed: The red borders around islands stayed on the screen after guessing an island.
            - Fixed: Cleared the `all_island_edges` list when generating a new map to remove the borders of previously guessed islands.

        6. Game Not Resetting Correctly:
            - Noticed: After finishing a game and clicking "Play Again," the game did not reset correctly.
            - Fixed: Passed `scale_factor` and `rows` to the `draw_precision_mode_summary` and `draw_time_trial_summary` functions to ensure the game resets properly.

        7. Flood Fill Visualization Lag:
            - Noticed: The flood fill visualization caused noticeable lag during the game.
            - Fixed: Optimized the flood fill algorithm to reduce lag and improve performance.

        8. Incorrect Cell Highlighting:
            - Noticed: The wrong cells were being highlighted when hovering over the map.
            - Fixed: Corrected the cell calculation logic to ensure the correct cells are highlighted.

        9. Hover Effect Not Updating:
            - Noticed: The hover effect was not updating correctly when moving the mouse over the map.
            - Fixed: Ensured the `hover_pos` variable is updated and passed correctly to the `redraw` function.


    Ways you would test the projects of other contestants (inputs, actions you would do etc.):
        1. Functional Testing:
            - Make sure the game starts and all buttons work.
            - Try each game mode (Normal, Time Trial, Precision) to see if they work as expected.
            - Check if the timer in Time Trial Mode stops during calculations and starts again after.
            - Make sure the tries left in Precision Mode go down after each wrong guess.

        2. Usability Testing:
            - See if the user interface is easy to understand and use.
            - Check if messages for correct and wrong guesses are clear and easy to read.
            - Make sure the game gives good feedback when you do something (like highlighting missed islands).

        3. Performance Testing:
            - Test the game with different map sizes to see if it runs smoothly.
            - Check if the game can handle a lot of islands without slowing down.

        4. Edge Case Testing:
            - Try clicking outside the map to see what happens.
            - Check how the game acts when you run out of tries in Precision Mode.

    Improvements/features you would make if you had a magic wand (able to do anything you wish for):
        1. Better Graphics:
            - Improve the visual quality of the game with high-resolution textures and animations.
            - Add lighting and shadows to make the game look more realistic.

        2. Multiplayer Mode:
            - Add a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other in real-time.
            - Include leaderboards to show the top players' scores.

        3. Play against CPU:
           - Add advanced CPU opponents that can challenge players with different difficulty levels(like in the chess game on windows).


    Think of how some factors could affect your solution (e.g. map size, number of livesâ€¦):
        1. Map Size:
            - Bigger maps could make the game more challenging and fun, but also harder to manage.
            - We would need to make sure the game runs smoothly with bigger maps, so optimizing performance would be key.

        2. Number of Lives:
            - Giving more lives in Precision Mode could make the game more enjoyable for beginners.
            - It's important to find a balance so the game stays challenging but not too hard.

        3. Time Limits:
            - Changing the time limits in Time Trial Mode could change how fast-paced the game feels.
            - Shorter time limits would make the game more intense and require quicker decisions.

        4. Island Density:
            - Having more islands could make it tougher to find and pick the right ones.
            - Adding hints or visual aids could help players navigate maps with lots of islands more easily.
